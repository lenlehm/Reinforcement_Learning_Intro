# Reinforcement_Learning_Intro
Dive into Reinforcement Learning along with a university project

As part of my studies at TUM, I chose the topic reinforcement lerning for robust behavior in autonomous cars. 
Thus, we implemented a A2C model to get familiar with the topic. 
The main goal is to have a PPO model to contribute to the open-source platform Bark, which is a benchmarking tool for autonomous cars with respect to behavior planning.
